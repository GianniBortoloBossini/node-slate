## Before you start

MailUp REST API follows OAuth 2.0 specification and authorizes only the applications that specify a pair of valid access keys ("Client ID" and "Client Secret") in the authentication process. 

## How to get API access keys

To get your access keys, you must register your application by following this procedure:  
+ Request a MailUp Developer account.
+ Log into your MailUp Developer account and click on the "Developer" tab in the navigation bar on the left. You can now request your MailUp API keys by pressing the "+" button and filling out the form. You will be asked to fill out a brief form.
+ Then press the "Request keys" button. 
+ Finally, you get to a page that contains the "Access keys". You can copy those keys and paste them in your application. When registering your application, you can ignore the "Request publication" button
