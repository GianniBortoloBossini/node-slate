# Best practices 

## Plan your integration

Start choosing the use cases that better fit your needs and then select a technical solution that covers your requirements. You can use a mix different solutions. 

For each use case listed on <a href="http://help.mailup.com/display/mailupapi/Use+cases+and+recommended+methods" target="_blank">Use Cases and recommended methods</a>, there may be more than one technical solution available: each one is slightly different from the others in terms of features, scalability or something else.

A broad <a href="http://help.mailup.com/display/mailupapi/Compare+API+solutions" target="_blank">comparison matrix</a> for available technical solutions is available <a href="http://help.mailup.com/display/mailupapi/Compare+API+solutions" target="_blank">here</a>.

## Check requirements

In some cases the chosen solution may require access to features or level of access that your account may not have at the moment. For example, your account may be restricted due to a free trial status, or you may need the setup of a batch process (e.g. <a href="http://help.mailup.com/display/mailupapi/FTP-based+integration" target="_blank">FTP based integrations</a> require a specific setup by our support department). Please contact us if you get stuck or need a special configuration.

## Use sample code

Some API pages provide code snippets or examples of input/output parameters. It is recommended that you check them out in order to get familiar with available API methods. For example:

+ SOAP API: <a href="http://help.mailup.com/display/mailupapi/Code+Samples" target="_blank">Code Samples</a>
